    what is the difference between inline and block elements in HTML?
    <p>Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available. For example, div, h1, p, form, header, footer, section, article, aside, nav, ul, ol, li, table, tr, td, th, tbody, thead, tfoot, blockquote, pre, hr, and more.</p>
    <p>Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. For example, span, a, strong, em, img, br, input, button, label, select, textarea, and more.</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
        <p>This is a <span style="color: blue;">blue inline</span> word inside a block element.</p>
    </div>
