// Key Features of MongoDB:
// Document-Oriented:

// Data is stored in documents (similar to JSON objects) inside collections.
// Each document can have a different structure (schema-less).
// Example of a document in MongoDB:

// json
// Copy code

// {
//   "_id": 1,
//   "name": "Alice",
//   "age": 30,
//   "email": "alice@example.com"
// }

// Flexible Schema:

// MongoDB allows you to have documents with different fields, so the database schema can evolve over time without causing issues, which makes it highly flexible for modern applications.
// Scalability:

// MongoDB supports horizontal scaling (sharding) and replication. It can handle very large datasets by distributing data across multiple servers.
// Indexing:

// MongoDB provides powerful indexing features for optimizing queries, making searching through large datasets faster.
// Aggregation Framework:

// MongoDB includes an aggregation framework for processing data and performing complex transformations and computations, similar to SQL GROUP BY or JOIN but more flexible.
// High Availability:

// MongoDB supports replica sets, providing automatic failover and data redundancy. This ensures that the database remains available in case of a server failure.
// Performance:

// MongoDB is designed to handle high write loads and large datasets, making it a good fit for applications that require fast reads and writes.
// No SQL (Non-relational):

// MongoDB is a NoSQL database, meaning it doesn't rely on structured query language (SQL) and does not require predefined schemas. It uses its own query language based on JSON.
