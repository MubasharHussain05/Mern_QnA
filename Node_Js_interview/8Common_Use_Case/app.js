// What are some common use cases for
// Node.js?


// 1. Web Applications
// Node.js is excellent for building web applications, particularly those requiring real-time communication, scalability, and performance.

// Use Case: Developing single-page applications (SPAs) and server-side rendered (SSR) applications.
// Examples:
// Real-time chat applications.
// Social media platforms.
// Blogs and content management systems (CMS).
// 2. Real-Time Applications
// Node.js’s non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture make it ideal for real-time applications.

// Use Case: Handling simultaneous data streams and live updates.
// Examples:
// Chat applications (e.g., Slack, Discord).
// Online gaming platforms.
// Live collaboration tools (e.g., Google Docs-like applications).
// 3. RESTful APIs and Microservices
// Node.js is commonly used to create lightweight, efficient APIs and microservices.

// Use Case: Building APIs for client-server communication.
// Examples:
// Backend services for mobile or web applications.
// APIs for e-commerce platforms, social networks, and payment gateways.
// 4. Streaming Applications
// Node.js’s native support for streams makes it ideal for data streaming applications.

// Use Case: Handling and processing large streams of data efficiently.
// Examples:
// Media streaming services (e.g., Netflix).
// Audio or video encoding in real-time.
// File uploads and downloads.
// 5. IoT Applications
// Node.js is widely used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to its lightweight nature and ability to handle multiple device connections.

// Use Case: Building server-side logic for IoT devices.
// Examples:
// Smart home automation.
// IoT sensor data aggregation and analysis.
// 6. E-Commerce Platforms
// Node.js supports real-time functionality, which is crucial for e-commerce platforms with dynamic product displays, live updates, and chatbots.

// Use Case: Building scalable and interactive shopping platforms.
// Examples:
// Shopping cart systems.
// Inventory management systems.
// Payment gateways.
// 7. Real-Time Collaboration Tools
// With its ability to handle WebSocket connections and real-time updates, Node.js is ideal for collaborative tools.

// Use Case: Enabling real-time interaction and updates.
// Examples:
// Collaborative text editors (e.g., Google Docs).
// Task management tools (e.g., Trello).
// Whiteboarding and brainstorming applications.
// 8. Serverless Architecture
// Node.js works well with serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions).

// Use Case: Executing server-side logic in response to specific triggers or events.
// Examples:
// Running event-driven backend processes.
// Creating API gateways.
// Processing image or video files in the cloud.
// 9. Cross-Plat
