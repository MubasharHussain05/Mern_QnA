// what is oop and why we use it?
// Oop is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. 
// It makes the code more reusable and maintainable. It is used to create real-world applications.
//OOP is a powerful tool for developing complex programs, and it's used in many popular programming languages. 

//Advantages of oop:

// Modularity: Breaks down code into smaller, more manageable parts, making it easier to maintain and update 
// Encapsulation: Controls access to data by hiding internal implementation, which promotes code reusability and security 
// Abstraction: Creates models that represent complex systems 
// Inheritance: Allows for code reusability and the extension of existing classes 
// Polymorphism: Provides flexibility in how code is used 
// Scalability: Allows for the creation of systems that can be easily upgraded from small to large 
// Problem solving: Breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable chunks 
// Troubleshooting: Makes it easier to identify and isolate problems 
// Extensibility: Makes it easier to add new features to a program without changing existing code 
// Flexibility: Allows for the creation of flexible and adaptable systems 
// Security: Ensures minimal exposure to data corruption 
// Efficiency: Improves the efficiency of code by reducing redundancy and increasing reusability

// Disadvantages of oop:
// Complexity: OOP programs can be complex to design, especially for large systems. 
// Performance: OOP programs can be slower than other types of programs because they require more code processing. 
// Memory usage: OOP programs can use more memory than other types of programs. 
// Development time: OOP programs can take longer to develop. 
// Security risks: OOP programs can have security risks like memory leaks, resource exhaustion, and garbage collection pauses. 
// Inheritance limitations: Inheritance can be difficult to maintain and extend, especially when dealing with multiple inheritance, tight coupling, and overriding. 
// Not suitable for all problems: OOP is not a universal language and may not be suitable for all types of problems. 
// Learning curve: OOP can be tricky to learn and may not be natural for some people. 
// Unit testing: Unit testing can be difficult because of the interactions between objects. 
// Code bloat: Extensive class definitions can lead to code bloat.

//what is class and object?
// A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), 
// and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
// An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.
// and object is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior.


//what is access modifier?
// Access modifiers are keywords that define the scope of a class, method, or variable. 
// They control the visibility and accessibility of a class, method, or
// variable to other classes and methods. There are four types of access modifiers in Java
// : public, private, protected, and default (no modifier).

//what is difference between public, private, protected and default access modifier?
// Public: Public access modifier is accessible from anywhere. It has the widest scope among all the access modifiers.
// Private: Private access modifier is accessible only within the class in which it is declared. It has the narrowest scope among all the access modifiers.
// Protected: Protected access modifier is accessible within the same package and subclasses. It has a wider scope than private but narrower than public.
// Default: Default access modifier is accessible only within the same package. It has a wider scope than private but narrower than protected.


//what is difference between structure and class?
// A structure is a user-defined data type that groups related data items of different data types. 
// It is a value type that can contain fields, properties, and methods.
//example:
// struct Person {
//   string name;
//   int age;
// }

// A class is a user-defined data type that groups related data items of different data types. 
// It is a reference type that can contain fields, properties, methods, and events.

//what is overloading and overriding?
// Overloading: Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but different parameters.
// Overloading is also known as compile-time polymorphism or static polymorphism.

// Overriding: Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.
// Overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism.

//what is constructor and destructor?
// Constructor: A constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize an object of a class.
// It is called when an object is created, and it has the same name as the class.

// Destructor: A destructor is a special type of method that is used to destroy an object of a class.
// It is called when an object is destroyed, and it has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~).
//it is used to free up resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the object.
//example:
// class Person {
//   constructor(name, age) {
//     this.name = name;
//     this.age = age;
//   }

//   sayHello() {
//     console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
//   }

//   ~Person() {
//     console.log(`Goodbye, ${this.name}!`);
//   }
// }

//what is virtual and pure virtual function?
// Virtual function: A virtual function is a member function that is declared within a base class and is redefined by a derived class.
// example:
// class Animal {
//   virtual void makeSound() {
//     console.log("Animal makes a sound");
//   }
// }


// Pure virtual function: A pure virtual function is a virtual function that is declared within a base class but has no implementation.
// It must be overridden by a derived class.
//example:
// class Animal {
//     virtual void makeSound() = 0;
//     }

//what is difference between abstract class and interface?
// Abstract class: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define common behavior for its subclasses.
// It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.

// Interface: An interface is a reference type that defines a set of abstract methods that a class must implement.
// It is used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
